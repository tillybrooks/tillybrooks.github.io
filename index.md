    <h1>Hi, I'm Tilden "Tilly" Brooks</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website! I'm a Ph.D. student in Linguistics at Stanford and J.D. candidate at Yale Law School exploring the intersection of linguistics and law.  I have a wide range of interests in both fields including semantics, pragmatics, psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics, legal interpretation, civil rights, evidence, and criminal justice.</p>
