    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I've had the good fortune to be exposed to several areas  of linguistics in my career so far.  My interest in the field began with a passion for Indo-European philology, which quickly expanded into an interest in historical linguistics.  While pursuing a B.A. with specializations in historical linguistics and semantics/pragmatics, I had the opportunity to work as an undergraduate research assistant for a law professor and sociolinguist.  These experiences inspired me to pursue the interface of law and language.  More specifically, I was drawn to the prospect of doing social science for people rather than merely about them.</p>

As a linguist, I am primarily a semanticist with an interest in sociolinguistically-informed theoretical and experimental approaches.  I also have an interest in psycholinguistics and computational methods.  My legal interests include evidence, civil rights (especially employment discrimination), legal history, and criminal justice.

I generally group my work as into the three following categories:

1. **The language of law**: What can the systematic study of language in legal contexts reveal about natural language as a social and cognitive phenomenon?
2. **The law of language**: How do legal processes affect language usage and linguistic minorities in the U.S.?
3. **Linguists in the legal realm**: What experiences do linguists have when they interact with legal systems in the U.S.?  How can linguistic insight be most effectively mobilized for the purpose of advancing justice?
